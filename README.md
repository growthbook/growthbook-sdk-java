### Releasing a new version

For now we are manually managing the version number.

When making a new release, ensure the file `growthbook/sdk/java/Version.java` has the version matching the tag and release. For example, if you are releasing version `0.3.0`, the following criteria should be met:

- the tag should be `0.3.0`
- the release should be `0.3.0` 
- the contents of the `Version.java` file should include the version as `static final String SDK_VERSION = "0.3.0";`
